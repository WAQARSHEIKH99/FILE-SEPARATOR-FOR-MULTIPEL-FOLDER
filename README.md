# Folder Processor

## Description
Folder Processor is a Python application that helps you organize your files. It processes a selected directory and its subdirectories, creating a new folder in each one and moving certain files into the new folder.

## Features
- **Directory Selection**: Choose the directory you want to process.
- **Custom Folder Names**: Specify the name of the new folder to be created in each directory.
- **File Extension Selection**: Choose which file extensions to process. By default, the application processes ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", and ".yaml" files.
- **Add/Remove Extensions**: Dynamically add or remove file extensions to be processed.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track the progress of the operation with a progress bar.
- **Cancel Operation**: Cancel the processing operation at any time.

## How it Works
1. The user selects a directory to process.
2. The user specifies the name of the new folder to be created in each directory.
3. The user selects which file extensions to process.
4. When the user clicks the "Process Folders" button, the application creates a new folder with the specified name in each directory and moves all files with the selected extensions into the new folder.

## Usage
1. Run the executable file or the Python script to start the application.
2. Select the directory you want to process.
3. Enter the name of the new folder you want to create in each directory.
4. Check the boxes next to the file extensions you want to process.
5. Click the "Process Folders" button to start processing the folders.
6. Click the "Cancel" button to stop the processing at any time.
